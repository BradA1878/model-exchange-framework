## Game Rules

1. Each player starts with 7 cards
2. On your turn, ask another player for a rank you have
3. If they have cards of that rank, you get them ALL
4. If not, "Go Fish!" - draw from the deck
5. If you draw the rank you asked for, you go again!
6. Collect 4 of a kind to make a "book" and score a point
7. Most books when all 13 are collected wins!

## Features

- **2 AI players** with unique personalities
- **Real-time card updates** via WebSocket
- **Table talk** - players banter and react
- **Thinking indicators** during AI reasoning
- **Book progress tracking** - visual progress bar

## MCP Tools

Just 3 simple tools:

- `game_getHand()` - Get your cards, books, and available targets
- `game_askForCards(targetId, rank)` - Ask another player for cards
- `game_taunt(message)` - Send a message to the table

## Color Scheme

- **Emerald/Teal** - Primary accent colors
- **Gold** - Highlights and achievements
- Each player has a unique hue

## Why This Example?

This demonstrates:
1. **Hidden information** - Players can't see each other's cards
2. **Memory and strategy** - Remembering what others asked for
3. **Turn continuation** - Multiple actions per turn when successful
4. **Personality-driven gameplay** - Characters react to events

More complex than Tic-Tac-Toe but still fast and entertaining!
