description: Commit current changes with meaningful message
---

Stage and commit all current changes with a meaningful commit message.

**Steps:**
1. Review current changes: `git status` and `git diff`
2. Stage relevant files: `git add <files>`
3. Create a descriptive commit message based on what changed
4. Commit the changes

**Guidelines:**
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use conventional commit format when appropriate (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Don't commit sensitive files (.env, credentials, etc.)
- Group related changes into logical commits
